## USAGE
    // TODO

## STATUS
This software should be considered (very) experimental. Interfaces, both
private and public, are still subject to change as the architecture of this
tool matures.

This tool was created to aid me in performing ad-hoc testing of network failure
scenarios when developing network software at [my day job](http://www.solacesystems.com). My employer 
graciously accepted I release it as open source.
